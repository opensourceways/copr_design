  Your information are below.  We suggest you to put that text into
  the <strong>~/.config/rhcopr</strong> file, and use it together with
  <a href="https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/internal-copr/docs/-/wikis/how-to-enable">
    the <strong>rhcopr</strong> wrapper
  </a>.  Without the wrapper you will have to use <strong>copr --config</strong>
  manually.
